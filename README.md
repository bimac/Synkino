# SynkinoLC

Allows sound playback synchronised to a running, jittery Super 8 projector.

SynkinoLC started as a fork of [fwachsmuth/Synkino](https://github.com/fwachsmuth/Synkino) with the following changes:

* While the original Synkino relies on two 8-bit ATmega328P microcontrollers (one for the frontend, one for the backend), SynkinoLC makes use of a single 32-bit ARM processor by means of a Teensy microcontroller board.
* SynkinoLC uses only a few off-the-shelf components to make assembly as straightforward as possible. No SMD soldering is required.
* The firmware has been optimized to fit the 62K flash of the affordable but powerful Teensy LC microcontroller board (with a few limitations - see below). Teensy 3.2 is also supported and allows for the full feature-set.
* Unlike the original Synkino, SynkinoLC is not designed for battery operation. Use any micro-USB phone charger as a power supply unit.
* When connected to a host via USB you'll have direct access to SynkinoLC's SD card via MTP (Teensy 3.2 only).
* SD cards can be formatted from SynkinoLC - depending on their size to either FAT16, FAT32, or ExFAT (Teensy 3.2 only).
* When storing a track numbered 999 (e.g., ```999-24.ogg```) to the SD card, SynkinoLC will automatically begin playing it after start-up.

Most parts of [Friedemann's manual for the original Synkino](https://www.filmkorn.org/synkino-instruction-manual/?lang=en) apply for SynkinoLC as well.


## Teensy LC vs Teensy 3.2

When assembling SynkinoLC, you can chose between using a Teensy LC or Teensy 3.2 microcontroller board. As of writing, however, Teensy 3.2 microcontrollers are not available for purchase due to the global chip shortage. While Teensy LC has more than enough processing power for SynkinoLC, it comes with a few minor limitations that are linked to its smaller flash of only 62K (vs 256K on Teensy 3.2):

* The binary patch file for the VS1053b audio decoder (```patches.053```) cannot be included with the firmware and needs to be supplied by means of the microSD-card.
* You can store settings for "only" 7 projectors (vs 15 on Teensy 3.2).
* The USB stack has been omitted - you can't use debugging by means of USBSerial. You can, however, use the Teensy's HW serial interface (TX on pin 1, 31250 baud).
* SdFat is running in low-mem mode (no support for exFAT, limited to 32GB cards and 64 character filenames).
* No MTP access to the SD card.
* No option for formatting the SD card.

Neither of these limitations should have a significant impact on the usability of SynkinoLC.


## Building the Firmware

SynkinoLC was created with [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/what-is-platformio.htm) for VSCode. To install PlatformIO:

1. [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install official Microsoft Visual Studio Code. PlatformIO IDE is built on top of it.
2. Open VSCode Package Manager.
3. Search for the official PlatformIO IDE extension.
4. Install PlatformIO IDE.

See [the official guide](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html) for more details on the VSCode integration.

To build SynkinoLC:
* open ```Synkino.code-workspace```,
* select the respective project environment (```env:teensyLC``` or ```enc:teensy31```), and
* start the build

The firmware won't fit TeensyLC unless ```SD.h``` is modified as outlined [here](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/SD/pull/44/commits/c3661d2aef4534b5e9cb3a7f66da09e8c61bf286). A pre-build script will attempt to patch this file automatically.


## Choice of OLED display

SynkinoLC has been designed to work with two types of 1.3" OLED display, based on either SH1106 or SSD1306 driver chips:
* An SH1106 display module (as used in the original Synkino) can be obtained for little money on [aliexpress.com](https://aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=sh1106+128+64) (go for the one that says ```1.30"OLED 4-SPI``` on the back). Other SH1106 modules should work as well, as long as they have identical pin-out (the foot-print for the retaining screws might not be an exact fit though).
* Alternatively, you can go for [Adafruit #938](https://octopart.com/938-adafruit+industries-32979003) which is based on an SSD1306 driver (you'll have to cut two traces on the back of the module to enable SPI as demonstrated [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXfV4e_jpf8))

Just connect the display module to the respective slot on the SynkinoLC PCB - the firmware will automatically detect the type of display used.
